# MatrixCalculator

Simple app doing selected calculations on matrices (dimensions 2x2 or 3x3) in graphical user interface, writed in Matlab language.

In this program you can use option such as:
1. determinant calculation
2. matrix transposition
3. multiplication two matrices
4. substraction two matrices
5. addiction two matrices
6. clean - two buttons to remove appropriate values of matrix and result
7. possibility to change dimension of matrices (available 2x2 and 3x3 dimensions)
8. possibility to throw results into matrix A or matrix B - buttons visible when result exist (These options are not visible when we execute determinant calculation because cannot thow determinant into matrix).
